{% info_block warningBox "Don't risk your go-live" %}

The preparation steps listed here are mandatory because they're crucial for the success of your go-live. We strongly encourage you to complete these steps where applicable because we won't be able to resolve issues related to steps not completed in time. Make sure that your project plan contains the tasks related to the go-live checklist and allocates enough time for their completion.

This document describes how to prepare a Spryker project for going live.

We've divided the preparation into approximate timeframes, and you can adjust them to your needs. Make sure that all of the following tasks are completed at least one week before going live.

## Eight weeks before go-live

| CLO-09 | Cloud       | Establish post-launch monitoring plan                  | To watch the system's performance and configure alerting mechanisms, establish a robust post-launch monitoring plan. To ensure effective investigation in case of security incidents, we recommend configuring logs to gather in a centralized SIEM system.                                                                            |                                                                              |
| CLO-10 | Cloud       | Set up deploy file                                     | Verify that your deploy file is set up correctly and aligns with your project needs. Verify that your project works and operates the production endpoints. You can set both testing and production endpoints in your deploy file. Your developers need to mock a "live" operation of the project with its production endpoints by adjusting their local host entries.|                                                                              |
| CLO-11 | Cloud       | Deploy production environment                          | Deploy the production environment regularly. This lets you detect potential issues early enough to fix them before going live. For instructions, see [Deploying in a production environment](/docs/ca/dev/deploy-in-a-production-environment.html). Make sure to test all [recipes](/docs/dg/dev/sdks/the-docker-sdk/installation-recipes-of-deployment-pipelines.html#staging-and-production-environment-recipes).|                                                                              |
| CLO-12 | Cloud       | Confirm DNS strategy                                   |         - You know how users are going to access your shop. Verify that you control access to the DNS to be able to manage DNS. For example, you want to use `spryker.com` as the domain for your shop, but you want a user to access the Storefront by the `www.spryker.com` subdomain. For details on how to set up DNS for your application, see [Set up DNS](/docs/ca/dev/set-up-dns.html).<br>- Optional: Delegate DNS. To find out how to delegate a DNS name, see [Setting up a custom SSL certificate](/docs/ca/dev/setting-up-a-custom-ssl-certificate.html).<br>- Make sure Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates are provisioned. If you delegate DNS to Spryker, TLS certificates for your endpoints are created automatically. If you want us to create TLS certificates for your endpoints but don't want to delegate your DNS, request the verification of DNS records through the [Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com). If you don't delegate your DNS and want to use your own certificates, provide them to us as described in [Setting up a custom SSL certificate](/docs/ca/dev/setting-up-a-custom-ssl-certificate.html).|                                                                              |
| CLO-13 | Cloud       | Decide Email sending handling                          | Decide how email sending should be handled. If you want to send emails using Spryker, decide whether you want to use the native mail service shipped with Spryker Cloud Commerce OS or integrate a third-party one. If you want to use the native one, let us know the email address that you want to send emails from. We will lift sending restrictions and help you validate the needed DNS name. For more information about the default email service and its restrictions, see [Email service](/docs/ca/dev/email-service/email-service.html).                                                                          |

| APP-27 | Application | Check environment variables                            | Double-check whether you have all needed environment variables and parameter store values set up. Remember that this has some lead time on our side. If you are still missing parameters, create them.|                                                                              |
| APP-28 | Application | Prepare DB creation in production                      | Prepare and implement database creation in production.

| TES-04 | Testing  | Test Third-party integrations on production              | Make sure to test that your third-party integrations and plugins are available and working properly when switched to production mode, using production credentials. Often, you may need to comply with specific additional security measures, such as IP whitelisting or port configuration. Conduct performance testing for third-party systems, especially if they are involved in critical customer flows like checkout or order placement.|                                                                              |
| TES-05 | Testing  | Conduct load tests                                     | Conduct load tests. The sample data used for testing should be comparable to the size and complexity of the production data.
| TES-06 | Testing  | Conduct stress and performance tests                   | Test your production environment and assess its performance. Since production environments typically employ horizontal auto-scaling, it's essential to  under expected average and peak loads. These tests enable our team to optimize the environment's vertical scaling in advance, ensuring that it can seamlessly handle the expected loads from the get-go without any potential delays caused by auto-scaling mechanisms. This proactive approach eliminates the need for post-launch adjustments.| To make this process work effectively, maintain active communication with us. Inform us about your load and performance test plans and share the results so that we can fine-tune the environment to meet your specific requirements. |
| TES-07 | Testing  | Conduct penetration tests                              | We highly recommend performing a penetration test by an independent third-party provider and addressing the identified vulnerabilities. Before conducting a penetration test, inform Spryker at least two weeks in advance by completing [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfunn1HY-nsqueP6sRQSLmScUWlmmQyQJk9cscIVIP_5BmuOw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
| TES-08 | Testing  | Real data import                                       | Import real data on production. After the import is complete, double-check the completeness and accuracy of the migrated data, especially if transitioning from another platform. | Start working with data of realistic size and quality as early as possible. At this point, you must be importing data regularly to all your environments. We recommend working with the same import data across all your environments. This significantly simplifies troubleshooting and helps you estimate import performance, leading up to your go-live and helping us with environment sizing considerations. We expect all our customers to follow this advice.
| TES-09 | Testing  | Test Checkout and OMS                                  | Validate the checkout and OMS process: general checkout steps, shipment, payment, OMS.
| TES-10 | Testing  | Test Payment                                           | Lower or nonproduction environments may not have the same WAF and firewall settings configured as production environments. Therefore, make sure that all your requests have valid headers. Also, test the functionality of payment integrations that use call-backs or depend on API calls to your application in your production environment.
| DAT-01 | Data     | Prepare a data migration plan                          | Prepare a data migration plan. Include all the data.
| SEO-03 | SEO      | Generate sitemap                                       | Generate sitemap.
| SEO-04 | SEO      | Set robots.txt                                         | Prepare and set the `robots.txt` file.
| SEO-05 | SEO      | Prepare and set static content                         | Prepare and set all the CMS pages and other content, including meta tags, internal and external links, etc.

If any of the preceding tasks aren't complete, postpone your go-live or discuss with us how to complete them in time. DNS changes are especially sensitive to deadlines. Because of the way the DNS system works, any DNS changes take time to take effect.
