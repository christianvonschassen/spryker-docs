{% info_block warningBox "Don't risk your go-live" %}

The preparation steps listed here are mandatory because they're crucial for the success of your go-live. We strongly encourage you to complete these steps where applicable because we won't be able to resolve issues related to steps not completed in time. Make sure that your project plan contains the tasks related to the go-live checklist and allocates enough time for their completion.

This document describes how to prepare a Spryker project for going live.

We've divided the preparation into approximate timeframes, and you can adjust them to your needs. Make sure that all of the following tasks are completed at least one week before going live.

## Eight weeks before go-live

| CLO-12 | Cloud       | Prepare a DNS strategy                                   | Decide how you want customers to access your shop and verify that you control access and can manage the DNS. For example, the domain of your shop is `spryker.com`, but you want customers to access the Storefront at `www.spryker.com`. For details on how to set up DNS, see [Set up DNS](/docs/ca/dev/set-up-dns.html).<br>- Optional: Delegate DNS. To find out how to delegate a DNS name, see [Setting up a custom SSL certificate](/docs/ca/dev/setting-up-a-custom-ssl-certificate.html).<br>- Make sure Transport Layer security (TLS) certificates are provisioned. If you delegate DNS to Spryker, TLS certificates for your endpoints are created automatically. If you want us to create TLS certificates for your endpoints but don't want to delegate your DNS, request the verification of DNS records through the [Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com). If you don't delegate your DNS and want to use your own certificates, provide them to us as described in [Setting up a custom SSL certificate](/docs/ca/dev/setting-up-a-custom-ssl-certificate.html). |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| CLO-13 | Cloud       | Decide Email sending handling                          | Decide how email sending should be handled. If you want to send emails using Spryker, decide whether you want to use the native mail service shipped with Spryker Cloud Commerce OS or integrate a third-party one. If you want to use the native one, let us know the email address that you want to send emails from. We will lift sending restrictions and help you validate the needed DNS name. For more information about the default email service and its restrictions, see [Email service](/docs/ca/dev/email-service/email-service.html).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
