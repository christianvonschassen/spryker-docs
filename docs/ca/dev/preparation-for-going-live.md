{% info_block warningBox "Don't risk your go-live" %}

The preparation steps listed here are mandatory because they're crucial for the success of your go-live. We strongly encourage you to complete these steps where applicable because we won't be able to resolve issues related to steps not completed in time. Make sure that your project plan contains the tasks related to the go-live checklist and allocates enough time for their completion.

This document describes how to prepare a Spryker project for going live.

We've divided the preparation into approximate timeframes, and you can adjust them to your needs. Make sure that all of the following tasks are completed at least one week before going live.

## Eight weeks before go-live


| CATEGORY | NAME     | DESCRIPTION               | NOTE     |
| --- |------------|--------------------|--------------|
| General | Plan Go live    | Let us know all the details of your go-live plan. Reach out to your Partner or Customer Success Manager and share your go-live plans: the date and time when you want to make your shop accessible to the public.     | If the time changes, keep us updated. This is critical for Domain Name System (DNS) switching and the hypercare phase we provide before and after your go-live.     |
| Cloud | Third-party systems integration                              | Make sure that there is a network diagram that can be used to explain the setup quickly if the need arises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Cloud | Third-party systems integration                              | Make sure that routing works as expected, and no internal resources are accidentally exposed via the Site-to-Site or VPC peering setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Cloud | Evaluate DOS and DDOS prevention (frontend)                | Check your concepts for denial-of-service (DOS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) prevention or mitigation, and check with relevant vendors for products that fit your needs and are compatible with SCCOS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Cloud | Set up whitelisting (security)                             | Web Application Firewalls (WAF) IPs, proxies, and other security and traffic filtering systems used to route traffic to Spryker are whitelisted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | This prevents these systems to be accidentally blocked by Spryker security systems. You can request IPs to be whitelisted via an Infrastructure Change Request on the [Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com/s/). |
| Application | Activate IP tracking                           | Activate IP tracking. [Activating IP tracking](https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk/blob/master/docs/07-deploy-file/02-deploy.file.reference.v1.md#cloud-define-gateway-ip-addresses) significantly increases chances to mitigate or spot malicious activities like DOS attacks. You might need to evaluate this from a data protection policy perspective.                                                                                                                             |

Besides striving for good user experience and transparency, make sure to consult with your legal team about any obligations in that regard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

## Four weeks before go-live


| CATEGORY    | NAME                                                   | DESCRIPTION                                                                    | NOTE                                                                         |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cloud       | Set up APM                                             | We highly recommend you to set up an Application Performance Monitoring (APM). | The APM tools help you identify performance bottlenecks in your application. |
| Cloud       | Establish post-launch monitoring plan                  | To watch the system's performance and configure alerting mechanisms, establish a robust post-launch monitoring plan. To ensure effective investigation in case of security incidents, we recommend configuring logs to gather in a centralized SIEM system.                                                                            |                                                                              |
| Cloud       | Set up deploy file                                     | Verify that your deploy file is set up correctly and aligns with your project needs. Verify that your project works and operates the production endpoints. You can set both testing and production endpoints in your deploy file. Your developers need to mock a "live" operation of the project with its production endpoints by adjusting their local host entries.|                                                                              |
| Cloud       | Deploy production environment                          | Deploy the production environment regularly. This lets you detect potential issues early enough to fix them before going live. For instructions, see [Deploying in a production environment](/docs/ca/dev/deploy-in-a-production-environment.html). Make sure to test all [recipes](/docs/dg/dev/sdks/the-docker-sdk/installation-recipes-of-deployment-pipelines.html#staging-and-production-environment-recipes).|                                                                              |
| Cloud       | Confirm DNS strategy                                   |         - You know how users are going to access your shop. Verify that you control access to the DNS to be able to manage DNS. For example, you want to use `spryker.com` as the domain for your shop, but you want a user to access the Storefront by the `www.spryker.com` subdomain. For details on how to set up DNS for your application, see [Set up DNS](/docs/ca/dev/set-up-dns.html).<br>- Optional: Delegate DNS. To find out how to delegate a DNS name, see [Setting up a custom SSL certificate](/docs/ca/dev/setting-up-a-custom-ssl-certificate.html).<br>- Make sure Transport Layer security (TLS) certificates are provisioned. If you delegate DNS to Spryker, TLS certificates for your endpoints are created automatically. If you want us to create TLS certificates for your endpoints but don't want to delegate your DNS, request the verification of DNS records through the [Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com). If you don't delegate your DNS and want to use your own certificates, provide them to us as described in [Setting up a custom SSL certificate](/docs/ca/dev/setting-up-a-custom-ssl-certificate.html).|                                                                              |
| Cloud       | Decide Email sending handling                          | Decide how email sending should be handled. If you want to send emails using Spryker, decide whether you want to use the native mail service shipped with Spryker Cloud Commerce OS or integrate a third-party one. If you want to use the native one, let us know the email address that you want to send emails from. We will lift sending restrictions and help you validate the needed DNS name. For more information about the default email service and its restrictions, see [Email service](/docs/ca/dev/email-service/email-service.html).                                                                          |
| Application | Prepare and communicate technical debt mitigation plan | Prepare and communicate technical debt mitigation plan. Develop a comprehensive plan to identify, address, and communicate strategies for managing technical debt before the system goes live. Make sure that all the stakeholders are aware of any missing or incomplete features and agree on the mitigation plan.|                                                                              |
| Application | Check environment variables                            | Double-check whether you have all needed environment variables and parameter store values set up. Remember that this has some lead time on our side. If you are still missing parameters, create them.|                                                                              |
| Application | Prepare DB creation in production                      | Prepare and implement database creation in production. For example, commit Propel migration for production and update deploy file to install the database from the committed migration files.|                                                                              |
| Testing     | Test Third-party integrations on production              | Make sure to test that your third-party integrations and plugins are available and working properly when switched to production mode, using production credentials. Often, you may need to comply with specific additional security measures, such as IP whitelisting or port configuration. Conduct performance testing for third-party systems, especially if they are involved in critical customer flows like checkout or order placement.|                                                                              |
| Testing     | Conduct load tests                                     | Conduct load tests. The sample data used for testing should be comparable to the size and complexity of the production data.
| Testing     | Conduct stress and performance tests                   | Test your production environment and assess its performance. Since production environments typically employ horizontal auto-scaling, it's essential to  under expected average and peak loads. These tests enable our team to optimize the environment's vertical scaling in advance, ensuring that it can seamlessly handle the expected loads from the get-go without any potential delays caused by auto-scaling mechanisms. This proactive approach eliminates the need for post-launch adjustments.| To make this process work effectively, maintain active communication with us. Inform us about your load and performance test plans and share the results so that we can fine-tune the environment to meet your specific requirements. |
| Testing     | Conduct penetration tests                              | We highly recommend performing a penetration test by an independent third-party provider and addressing the identified vulnerabilities. Before conducting a penetration test, inform Spryker at least two weeks in advance by completing [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfunn1HY-nsqueP6sRQSLmScUWlmmQyQJk9cscIVIP_5BmuOw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
| Testing     | Real data import                                       | Import real data on production. After the import is complete, double-check the completeness and accuracy of the migrated data, especially if transitioning from another platform. | Start working with data of realistic size and quality as early as possible. At this point, you must be importing data regularly to all your environments. We recommend working with the same import data across all your environments. This significantly simplifies troubleshooting and helps you estimate import performance, leading up to your go-live and helping us with environment sizing considerations. We expect all our customers to follow this advice.
| Testing     | Test checkout and OMS                                  | Validate the checkout and OMS process: general checkout steps, shipment, payment, OMS.
| Testing     | Test payment                                           | Lower or non-production environments may not have the same WAF and firewall settings configured as production environments. Therefore, make sure that all your requests have valid headers. Also, test the functionality of payment integrations that use call-backs or depend on API calls to your application in your production environment.
| Data        | Prepare a data migration plan                          | Prepare a data migration plan. Include all the data.
| SEO         | Generate sitemap                                       | Generate sitemap.
| SEO         | Set `robots.txt`                                         | Prepare and set the `robots.txt` file.
| SEO         | Prepare and set static content                         | Prepare and set all the CMS pages and other content, including meta tags, internal and external links, etc.
| SEO         | Set up favicon                                         | Set up [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon).

| General  | Check / Evaluate Go live date                 | Double-check the go-live date. If any of the preceding tasks aren't complete, postpone your go-live or discuss with us how to complete them in time. DNS changes are especially sensitive to deadlines. Because of the way the DNS system works, any DNS changes take time to take effect.
| General  | Check rollback strategy                       | Make sure that the rollback strategy is still valid. Check that you have everything you need to recover from an unforeseen issue with the newest version of the project you are deploying.
| General  | Set up DNS                                    | Make sure that DNS is set up.| For details on the DNS setup, see [Set up DNS](/docs/ca/dev/set-up-dns.html).
| General  | Set up third-party systems (production mode)    |  Make sure that the third-party systems have been switched to the production mode: Set up production configuration for all the third-party systems (in environment variables). Make sure not to expose secrets in the codebase.
| General  | Set up BI / Analytics tools (production mode) | Validate BI and analytics integrations. They should not be connected to your production database but rather to the provided read replica. Make sure no external system is interacting with your production database.
| General  | Establish a go-live support team              | Have a team that can monitor your go-live process, react quickly to any issues, and work with the Spryker Support or Operations teams.
